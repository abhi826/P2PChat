# Peer-to-Peer Chat

A simple LAN peer-to-peer chat application built with Qt/QML. You can run one instance in **server** (listen) mode and any number of **client** (connect) instances to chat over TCP.

## Features

- **Single-port setup**: one well-known port for listening; clients connect to that port.
- **Broadcast**: server relays every clientâ€™s messages to all other clients.
- **QML UI**: lightweight GUI for entering host/port, sending and displaying messages.
- **Cross-platform**: builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Qt 6.
